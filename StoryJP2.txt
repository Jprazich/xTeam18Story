Dwight Schrute walked into the office to find his desk was gone. Jim! His arch nemesis was back at it again. "Michael!" Jim smirked as he walked into Michael's office. Michael was on the phone with Jan, though. That might take some time. Frustrated, Dwight walked back out. He had already been up since 5 am milking the chickens and collecting eggs from the cows. He didn't have time to deal with Jim's shenanigans today. "All right, where's my desk," he said to Jim. "What do you mean, it's right there where it always is," said Jim.

Dwight, confused by the scenario had a dumbfounded look on his face. Pouting from the recent annoyance said "Jim, where is my desk." with even more force than beore. Jim with a smile on his face pointed in the bathrooms direction. With a quick turn, Dwight stormed off in search for his desk.
But first, "MICHAEL!" Dwight screamed. "What is it Dwight" snapped Michael. "This is an unacceptable way to treat the assistant regional manager!" Dwight screamed.

Michael walked out calmly and dimissed Dwight as he went to the break room. Dwight, slightly annoyed, went to the bathroom to see what happened to his desk. When he found that his desk had been moved into the bathroom he exploded with rage. But before Dwight could bring his rage upon all of the office there was a cut to commericals.

Cut back to Dwight as he slowly lifts his precious bobblehead out of the toilet with a note that read "Assistant to the regional manager". Jim would pay if it was the last thing he did. Then Dwight remembered Pam had an upcoming art show. Perfect, thought Dwight as he grinned maniacally.
