Dwight Schrute walked into the office to find his desk was gone. Jim! His arch nemesis was back at it again. "Michael!" Jim smirked as he walked into Michael's office. Michael was on the phone with Jan, though. That might take some time. Frustrated, Dwight walked back out. He had already been up since 5 am milking the chickens and collecting eggs from the cows. He didn't have time to deal with Jim's shenanigans today. "All right, where's my desk," he said to Jim. "What do you mean, it's right there where it always is," said Jim.
